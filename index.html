            <article>
                    <p>I‚Äôm a <strong>UX Researcher & Designer</strong>, superhero comic-book nerd ü¶∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, and science fiction aficionado. After working some time as a <strong>psychologist</strong> I discovered UX Design and I got captivated with how it merges a lot of the topics I‚Äôm passionate about. I moved to Barcelona and after studying to become a UX Designer I was hired to be part of Ironhack‚Äôs education team as a <strong>Teacher Assistant</strong>.

                    <h4>My values</h4>
                    <p>When working on a team I try to make empathy, communication and commitment my centric values. I believe in combining everyones best skills to not only make the best work possible, but also lo learn from each other and support the growth of every team member.<br><br>
                    In the topic of User Experience I‚Äôm a strong advocate for user research as the pillar of design decisions. I‚Äôm convinced that collecting information about people‚Äôs needs, goals, mental models, expectations, and usage patterns in all stages of a product lifecycle help teams make better decisions not only about what path to take a design but also about how and what to prioritize. </p>

                            <p>Doing research about the spanish healthcare system I realized that during the on call shift doctors from all over the country rely on pieces of paper to remember the patients that they have yet to attend. <br><br> After talking with doctors about the pain points of this approach I designed an easy to use app to not only register the patients to attend, but also to check quick information that took precious time from them and to add features that adjusted to already existing behaviors like saving cases to follow up in the following days.</p>

                        <p>I developed a Software as a Service (SaaS) desktop web app for companies to use internally. I had 5 days and my goal was to research the market and meeting people working in companies to understand their needs in the Human Resources field, to then develop a solution that had in mind both the end user and the company itself (which in the end is the one deciding to use the software in the end).</p>

                            <p>In the UX/UI design line of work, there are a lot of different projects we can undertake. Usually, people‚Äôs minds go to creating new apps or services, but more often than not you‚Äôll find yourself working for a company that already has an established brand identity, having apps and websites already working with their own look and feel and navigation process, and your work needs to adapt and reflect this already existing characteristics.</p>
